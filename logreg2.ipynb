    "Grid search CV (cross-validation) is a technique used to optimize hyperparameters in machine learning models. It works by systematically searching through a predefined grid of hyperparameters, evaluating the model's performance at each point using cross-validation, and selecting the combination that yields the best performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid search CV and random search CV are both used for hyperparameter tuning, but they differ in their approach. Grid search CV exhaustively searches through a predefined grid, while random search CV randomly samples the space of hyperparameters. Random search CV is often preferred when the number of hyperparameters is large or when the relationship between hyperparameters and performance is complex.\n",

    "Data leakage occurs when a model is trained on data that includes information about the target variable, which can lead to overfitting and poor generalization performance. For example, if a model is trained to predict stock prices using historical data that includes the actual prices, the model may learn to simply memorize the prices rather than learning the underlying patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4:\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent data leakage, it's important to ensure that the training data is representative of the data the model will encounter in real-world applications. Techniques such as data splitting, feature engineering, and regularization can help prevent data leakage.\n",

    "Q5:\n",

    "A confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It summarizes the predictions against the actual labels, providing insights into the accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6:\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision and recall are both important metrics in a confusion matrix. Precision measures the proportion of true positives among all predicted positives, while recall measures the proportion of true positives among all actual positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7:\n",
    "\n",
    "A confusion matrix can be used to identify which types of errors a model is making, such as false positives or false negatives. This information can be used to improve the model by adjusting the threshold or modifying the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8:\n",
    "\n",
    "Common metrics derived from a confusion matrix include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC. These metrics provide insights into the model's performance and can be used to compare different models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9:\n",
    "\n",
    "The accuracy of a model is closely related to the values in its confusion matrix. A high accuracy indicates a good balance between true positives and true negatives, while a low accuracy may indicate a bias towards one class or the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10:\n",
    "\n",
    "A confusion matrix can be used to identify potential biases or limitations in a machine learning model. For example, a model that consistently predicts one class over the other may indicate a bias in the data or the model. By analyzing the confusion matrix, you can identify areas for improvement and develop a more robust model."
