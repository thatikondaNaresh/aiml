    "Lasso Regression is a type of linear regression that uses L1 regularization to add a penalty term to the cost function. This penalty term encourages the model to have smaller coefficients, which can lead to feature selection. Lasso Regression differs from other regression techniques in its ability to perform feature selection and handle high-dimensional data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2:\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection is that it can automatically set the coefficients of irrelevant features to zero, effectively selecting the most important features in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3:\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficients of a Lasso Regression model represent the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the independent variable, while controlling for the other independent variables in the model. The coefficients are shrunk towards zero due to the regularization term, and some coefficients may be set to zero if the feature is not important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4:\n",
    "\n",
    "The tuning parameters in Lasso Regression are the regularization parameter (lambda) and the maximum number of iterations. The regularization parameter controls the strength of the penalty term, and the maximum number of iterations controls the convergence of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5:\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, Lasso Regression can be used for non-linear regression problems by using non-linear features, such as polynomials or splines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression are both regularization techniques, but they differ in the type of penalty term used. Ridge Regression uses an L2 penalty term, which encourages the model to have smaller coefficients, but does not set any coefficients to zero. Lasso Regression uses an L1 penalty term, which encourages the model to have smaller coefficients and can set some coefficients to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7:\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, Lasso Regression can handle multicollinearity in the input features. The L1 penalty term encourages the model to have smaller coefficients, which can help to reduce the impact of multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8:\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal value of the regularization parameter (lambda) in Lasso Regression can be chosen using cross-validation techniques, such as k-fold cross-validation. The goal is to find the value of lambda that minimizes the mean squared error (MSE) of the model."
