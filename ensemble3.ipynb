    "Q1:\n",
    "Random Forest Regressor is a type of ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to predict continuous outcomes. It is a variant of the Random Forest algorithm, which is commonly used for classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2:\n",
    "Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using multiple decision trees, each trained on a random subset of the data\n",
    "- Averaging the predictions of the individual trees to produce the final output\n",
    "- Reducing the correlation between trees through random feature selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3:\n",
    "Random Forest Regressor aggregates the predictions of multiple decision trees by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Training each tree on a random subset of the data\n",
    "- Predicting the target variable for each tree\n",
    "- Averaging the predictions of all trees to produce the final output\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4:\n",
    "The hyperparameters of Random Forest Regressor include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Number of trees (n_estimators)\n",
    "- Maximum depth of each tree (max_depth)\n",
    "- Minimum sample size for splitting (min_samples_split)\n",
    "- Minimum sample size for leaf nodes (min_samples_leaf)\n",
    "- Maximum features to consider for splitting (max_features)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5:\n",
    "The main difference between Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor is that Random Forest Regressor combines multiple trees to reduce overfitting, while Decision Tree Regressor uses a single tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6:\n",
    "Advantages of Random Forest Regressor:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduces overfitting\n",
    "- Handles high-dimensional data\n",
    "- Handles missing values\n",
    "- Provides feature importance scores\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Computationally expensive\n",
    "- Can be difficult to interpret\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7:\n",
    "The output of Random Forest Regressor is a continuous value representing the predicted target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8:\n",
    "No, Random Forest Regressor is designed for regression tasks and cannot be used for classification tasks directly. However, it can be used as a base model in a classification pipeline by using a classification algorithm on the output of the Random Forest Regressor."
