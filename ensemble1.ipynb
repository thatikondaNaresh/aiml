    "An ensemble technique in machine learning is a method that combines the predictions of multiple base models to produce a more accurate and robust prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2:\n",
    "Ensemble techniques are used in machine learning to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Improve accuracy and reduce error\n",
    "- Reduce overfitting and improve generalization\n",
    "- Increase robustness and handling of missing values\n",
    "- Provide a way to combine different models and features\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3:\n",
    "Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) is an ensemble technique that combines multiple instances of a base model, trained on different subsets of the training data, to produce a more accurate prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4:\n",
    "Boosting is an ensemble technique that combines multiple base models, trained on the residuals of the previous model, to produce a more accurate prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5:\n",
    "The benefits of using ensemble techniques include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Improved accuracy and reduced error\n",
    "- Increased robustness and handling of missing values\n",
    "- Ability to combine different models and features\n",
    "- Reduced overfitting and improved generalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6:\n",
    "No, ensemble techniques are not always better than individual models. The performance of an ensemble technique depends on the choice of base models, the ensemble method, and the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7:\n",
    "The confidence interval is calculated using bootstrap by repeatedly resampling the data with replacement, calculating the statistic of interest (e.g., mean), and using the distribution of the statistic to estimate the confidence interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8:\n",
    "Bootstrap works by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Resampling the data with replacement\n",
    "2. Calculating the statistic of interest (e.g., mean)\n",
    "3. Repeating steps 1-2 multiple times\n",
    "4. Using the distribution of the statistic to estimate the confidence interval\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9:\n",
    "To estimate the 95% confidence interval for the population mean height using bootstrap:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Resample the data with replacement 1000 times\n",
    "2. Calculate the mean height for each resampled dataset\n",
    "3. Sort the means in ascending order\n",
    "4. The 2.5th percentile and 97.5th percentile of the sorted means represent the 95% confidence interval\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the given data, the 95% confidence interval for the population mean height is approximately (14.3, 15.7) meters."
