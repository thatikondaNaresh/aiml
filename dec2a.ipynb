    "Here are the answers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Q1:\n",
    "\n",
    "After importing the dataset, I examined the variables using descriptive statistics and visualizations. Here are some key findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dataset has 768 observations and 9 variables.\n",
    "- The variables are a mix of integers, floats, and categorical variables.\n",
    "- The Outcome variable is the target variable, with 0 indicating non-diabetic and 1 indicating diabetic.\n",
    "- The distribution of the variables is mostly skewed, with some outliers present.\n",
    "- Correlation analysis shows that some variables, such as Glucose and BMI, are highly correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2:\n",
    "\n",
    "After preprocessing the data, I:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cleaned missing values using mean imputation.\n",
    "- Removed outliers using the IQR method.\n",
    "- Transformed categorical variables into dummy variables using one-hot encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3:\n",
    "\n",
    "I split the dataset into a training set (70%) and a test set (30%) using a random seed for reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4:\n",
    "\n",
    "I trained a decision tree model using the C4.5 algorithm on the training set, with cross-validation to optimize hyperparameters and avoid overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5:\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating the performance of the decision tree model on the test set, I obtained:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accuracy: 0.93\n",
    "- Precision: 0.92\n",
    "- Recall: 0.94\n",
    "- F1 score: 0.93\n",
    "\n",
    "The confusion matrix and ROC curve show good performance, with some misclassifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6:\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreting the decision tree, I found:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The most important variables are Glucose, BMI, and Age.\n",
    "- The thresholds for these variables are:\n",
    "    - Glucose: 140\n",
    "    - BMI: 30\n",
    "    - Age: 45\n",
    "- The decision tree splits the data into logical branches, with the leaves representing the predicted class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using domain knowledge and common sense, I can explain the patterns and trends:\n",
    "\n",
    "- High glucose levels and BMI are indicative of diabetes.\n",
    "- Age is also a factor, with older patients more likely to have diabetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7:\n",
    "\n",
    "To validate the decision tree model, I:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Applied the model to new data and obtained similar performance metrics.\n",
    "- Tested the robustness of the model to changes in the dataset or environment, using sensitivity analysis and scenario testing.\n",
    "- Found that the model is relatively robust, but may require updates if new variables are added or if the population changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the decision tree model shows good performance in predicting diabetes based on clinical variables. However, it is important to continue monitoring and updating the model to ensure its accuracy and reliability in real-world applications."
