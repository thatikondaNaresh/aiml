    "Q1: Explain the following with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "C) Artificial Intelligence\n",
    "L) Machine Learning\n",
    "D) Deep Learning\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "C) Artificial Intelligence: AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and mimic human actions. An example is speech recognition systems like Siri or Alexa.\n",
    "L) Machine Learning: ML is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. An example is spam email detection.\n",
    "D) Deep Learning: DL is a subset of ML that deals with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain's neural networks. An example is image and speech recognition in autonomous vehicles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: What is supervised learning? List some examples of supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data, and it learns to predict outcomes based on input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of supervised learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification tasks: Email spam detection, sentiment analysis.\n",
    "Regression tasks: Predicting house prices, stock market trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: What is unsupervised learning? List some examples of unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning involves training models on unlabeled data to find patterns or intrinsic structures within the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of unsupervised learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering: Grouping customers by purchasing behavior.\n",
    "Dimensionality reduction: PCA (Principal Component Analysis).\n",

    "Q4: What is the difference between AI, ML, DL, and DS?\n",
    "\n",
    "AI (Artificial Intelligence) is the broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a way that we would consider \"smart.\"\n",
    "ML (Machine Learning) is a subset of AI where machines learn from data to make decisions or predictions.\n",
    "DL (Deep Learning) is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers to learn from data.\n",
    "DS (Data Science) involves using scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5: What are the main differences between supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models to make predictions or decisions.\n",
    "Unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data to find hidden patterns or structures.\n",
    "Semi-supervised learning uses a combination of labeled and unlabeled data for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6: What is train, test, and validation split? Explain the importance of each term.\n",
    "\n",
    "Train set: Used to train the model, it's the portion of the dataset used for learning.\n",
    "Test set: Used to evaluate the model's performance after it has been trained.\n",
    "Validation set: Used to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters during training and to provide an unbiased evaluation of the model.\n",
    "Importance: These splits help in evaluating the model's performance, preventing overfitting, and ensuring generalizability to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7: How can unsupervised learning be used in anomaly detection?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning algorithms can detect anomalies by learning the normal patterns in the data and identifying instances that deviate significantly from those patterns. Examples include clustering-based approaches or density estimation methods.\n",
