    "\n",
    "To calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient, we can use the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "r = Σ((xi - x_mean)(yi - y_mean)) / sqrt(Σ(xi - x_mean)² * Σ(yi - y_mean)²)\n",
    "\n",
    "where xi and yi are the individual data points, x_mean and y_mean are the means of the two variables, and Σ denotes the sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating the means, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "x_mean = 6\n",
    "y_mean = 88.4\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we can calculate the numerator and denominator of the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerator: Σ((xi - x_mean)(yi - y_mean)) = 24\n",
    "Denominator: sqrt(Σ(xi - x_mean)² * Σ(yi - y_mean)²) = 14.14\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the Pearson correlation coefficient is:\n",
    "\n",
    "r = 24 / 14.14 = 0.73\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Ranking the data, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we can calculate the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "ρ = 1 - (6 * Σd²) / (n * (n² - 1))\n",
    "\n",
    "where d is the difference between the ranks, n is the number of data points, and Σ denotes the sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating the differences and summing them up, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "Σd² = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is:\n",
    "\n",
    "ρ = 1 - (6 * 2) / (5 * (5² - 1)) = 0.8\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that there is a strong positive monotonic relationship between sleep and job satisfaction.\n",

    "Using the data provided, we can calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient:\n",
    "\n",
    "r = -0.25\n",
