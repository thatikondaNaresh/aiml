    "Ordinal encoding assigns a numerical value to each category based on its rank or order, while label encoding assigns a unique numerical value to each category without considering its order. For example, in ordinal encoding, \"small\" might be assigned 0, \"medium\" might be assigned 1, and \"large\" might be assigned 2, while in label encoding, \"small\" might be assigned 0, \"medium\" might be assigned 2, and \"large\" might be assigned 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: If the categories have a natural order or hierarchy, such as education level (high school, bachelor's, master's, phd), ordinal encoding is appropriate. If the categories do not have a natural order or hierarchy, such as color (red, green, blue), label encoding is appropriate.\n",

    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique that assigns numerical values to categories based on their relationship with the target variable. For example, if the target variable is \"price\" and the categorical variable is \"size\", the encoding might assign higher values to larger sizes if larger sizes are associated with higher prices.\n",

    "Covariance is a measure of the linear relationship between two variables. It is important in statistical analysis because it helps to identify relationships between variables and to understand how variables move together. Covariance is calculated as the expected value of the product of the deviations of two variables from their means.\n",
