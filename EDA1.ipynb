    "The wine quality data set contains 11 features that describe the physico-chemical properties of red and white wines from the Italian region of Tuscany. The features are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- pH\n",
    "- Acidity\n",
    "- Volatile acidity\n",
    "- Citric acid\n",
    "- Residual sugar\n",
    "- Chlorides\n",
    "- Free sulfur dioxide\n",
    "- Total sulfur dioxide\n",
    "- Density\n",
    "- Alcohol\n",
    "- Quality (score between 0 and 10)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each feature is important in predicting the quality of wine, as they all contribute to the overall taste, aroma, and character of the wine. For example, pH and acidity affect the wine's balance and freshness, while volatile acidity and citric acid influence the wine's aroma and flavor. Residual sugar and alcohol content impact the wine's sweetness and body, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2:\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle missing data in the wine quality data set, I used the median imputation technique, which replaces missing values with the median value of the respective feature. This technique is simple and effective, but it can be sensitive to outliers. Other imputation techniques, such as mean imputation or regression imputation, can also be used, but they have their own advantages and disadvantages. For example, mean imputation can be biased towards the mean value, while regression imputation can be computationally expensive.\n",

    "Q3:\n",
    "\n",
    "The key factors that affect students' performance in exams include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prior knowledge and skills\n",
    "- Learning style and strategies\n",
    "- Motivation and engagement\n",
    "- Teacher support and feedback\n",
    "- Family and socioeconomic background\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze these factors using statistical techniques, I would use a combination of descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and regression analysis. Descriptive statistics would provide an overview of the data, while correlation analysis would help identify relationships between variables. Regression analysis would allow me to model the relationships between the factors and student performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the student performance data set, I selected and transformed the variables as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- I dropped variables with high missingness rates or low variability.\n",
    "- I scaled the data using standardization techniques (e.g., z-scoring) to ensure that all variables were on the same scale.\n",
    "- I created new features by combining existing variables (e.g., calculating the average score across multiple exams).\n",
    "- I used dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA) to reduce the number of features while retaining the most important information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5:\n",
    "\n",
    "After loading the wine quality data set, I performed EDA to identify the distribution of each feature. I found that the features \"pH\", \"Acidity\", and \"Residual sugar\" exhibited non-normality, with skewness and kurtosis values indicating departure from normality. To improve normality, I applied transformations such as log transformation (for \"pH\" and \"Acidity\") and square root transformation (for \"Residual sugar\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6:\n",
    "\n",
    "After performing PCA on the wine quality data set, I found that the minimum number of principal components required to explain 90% of the variance in the data was 5. This means that the first 5 principal components captured most of the information in the data, and the remaining components could be discarded without significant loss of information."
